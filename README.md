scripts for bachelor thesis

These are (almost) all the scripts which I used for my bachelor project.
The main objective is to produce tafel plots from multiple chronoamperometry measurements, and compare the slopes.
The scripts read, manage, and write all data on their own,
so it would need some adjustment to a different folder structure and OS in order to run.

The basic data processing should be clear though, and could be copied to other projects.
